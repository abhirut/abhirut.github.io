<p>
I am a Research Engineer at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/india/">IBM Research, Bangalore</a>, currently working on automating technical support. <a target="_blank" href="./DESIRE_ICSOC2016.pdf">Here's</a> a workshop paper we wrote about the system, set to appear in the proceedings of ICSOC 2016 Workshops.
</p>
<p>
Currently, I am working on the problem of extracting procedures from technical support documents like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSPG9M/Analytics/Admin/reallocating_credits_clientID.html">this one</a>, with the goal of driving conversation for guided support and automation.
</p>
<p>
I am also working on an IBM Open Science Collaboration Project with Prof. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ernet.in/~niloy/">Niloy Ganguly</a> from IIT Kharagpur, where we are trying to study evolution of ideas in scientific articles and how a research paper becomes "seminal".
